# About

**Front-End for react-eats written in React.js**

This application was developed as the phase 5 project for Flatiron School in Houston, Texas. The primary goal of this project is to address the common issue of finding food quickly when you're hungry. We understand that when hunger strikes, you don't want to waste time searching through endless results on the web to find the right place to eat. With "EATS.", we aim to make the process much easier by providing a user-friendly interface that allows you to view food options and find their locations with just a click of a button. The UI is designed using Material UI, ensuring a seamless and delightful user experience.

**Please note that this app is currently still in development.**

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Launches the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload automatically if you make any edits.\
Additionally, the console will display any lint errors.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information about running tests, see the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section in the Create React App documentation.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production and creates a `build` folder.\
The React app is bundled and optimized for the best performance.

The build process includes minification, and the filenames include unique hashes.\
Once the build is completed, your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information about deployment, see the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section in the Create React App documentation.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

The `eject` command should be used with caution as it is irreversible. It removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project directory, providing you with full control over them. Although the other commands will still work after ejecting, they will refer to the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. We recommend using `eject` only when you are confident in your customizations.

The Create React App offers a curated feature set suitable for small and medium deployments, making it unnecessary to use `eject` unless you require extensive customization. Nevertheless, we understand that having full control over the configuration is essential for some projects, and we provide this option for such cases.
