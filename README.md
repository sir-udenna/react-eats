# EATS - Your Food Finder App (Frontend)

**Note: This app is currently still in development.**

EATS is a web application developed as the phase 5 project for Flatiron School in Houston, Texas. Its primary goal is to address the common issue of finding food quickly when you're hungry. We understand that when hunger strikes, you don't want to waste time searching through endless results on the web to find the right place to eat. With "EATS.", we aim to make the process much easier by providing a user-friendly interface that allows you to view food options and find their locations with just a click of a button. The UI is designed using Material UI, ensuring a seamless and delightful user experience.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the project's dependencies.
